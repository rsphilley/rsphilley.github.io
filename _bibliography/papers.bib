	abstract = {Hybrid multiscale agent-based models (ABMs) are unique in their ability to simulate individual cell interactions and microenvironmental dynamics. Unfortunately, the high computational cost of modeling individual cells, the inherent stochasticity due to probabilistic phenotypic transitions, and numerous model parameters that are difficult to measure directly are fundamental limitations of applying such models to predict tumor dynamics. To overcome these challenges, we have developed a coarse-grained two-scale ABM (cgABM) calibrated with a set of time-resolved microscopy measurements of cancer cells grown with different initial conditions. The multiscale model consists of a reaction-diffusion type model capturing the spatio-temporal evolution of glucose and growth factors in the tumor microenvironment (at tissue scale), coupled with a lattice-free ABM to simulate individual cell dynamics (at cellular scale). The experimental data consists of BT474 human breast carcinoma cells initialized with different glucose concentrations and tumor cell confluences. The confluence of live and dead cells was measured every three hours over four days.   Given this model and data, we perform a global sensitivity analysis to identify the relative importance of the model parameters. The subsequent cgABM with a reduced parameter space is calibrated within a Bayesian framework to the experimental data to estimate model parameters, which are then used to predict the temporal evolution of the living and dead cell populations. To this end, a moment-based Bayesian inference is proposed to account for the stochasticity of the cgABM while quantifying uncertainties in model parameters and observational data. The results indicate that the cgABM can reliably predict the spatiotemporal evolution of breast cancer cells observed by the microscopy data with an average error and standard deviation for live and dead cells being 7.61 [[EQUATION]] 2.01 and 5.78 [[EQUATION]] 1.13, respectively.},
